ERROR: [Place 30-487] The packing of instances into the device could not be obeyed. There are a total of 19650 slices in the device, of which 18774 slices are available, however, the unplaced instances require 29582 slices. Please analyze your design to determine if the number of LUTs, FFs, and/or control sets can be reduced.

Number of control sets and instances constrained to the design
	Control sets: 30119
	Luts: 52351 (combined) 61036 (total), available capacity: 78600 
	Flip flops: 31226, available capacity: 157200
	NOTE: each slice can only accommodate 1 unique control set so FFs cannot be packed to fully fill every slice


ERROR: [Place 30-99] Placer failed with error: 'Detail Placement failed please check previous errors for details.'
Please review all ERROR, CRITICAL WARNING, and WARNING messages during placement to understand the cause for failure.
